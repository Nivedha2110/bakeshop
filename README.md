Bakeshop Project based on Python

Your team has been hired by Tech Excel Software who specialises in developing quite a different type of
systems for small to medium size businesses. The company is a firm believer in the Agile Process. Currently,
you are assigned to work as an outsource team on a new project for a client, Oliver, who is an owner to a
bakery shop Bake Shop.
Initially, the business was just about bakery. The staff at the counter will write the order on a slip and get
the order ready for the customer. Oliver was using a MS Excel sheet to keep the records of the inventory
and revenue.
A year ago, Oliver’s business started to do better, and decided to expand his kitchen to include appliances
that would make more baking products, coffee, breakfast and lunch. Due to the expansion of his business,
he is finding it hard to keep the track of all orders and the inventory. He would like to have software
developed for his business that can help him with managing orders and the inventory. So far, Oliver requires
the software to work only for the one bakery that he owns.
At first, Oliver provided just one paragraph of requirements as below.
First version of the requirements:
The software should allow Oliver (owner) and his staff to manage orders. Any user should be able to create,
modify, view or delete an order. The customers will go to the counter to ask for an order to be prepared and
pay by cash only. At the end of each month, the owner wants himself to be able to generate a list of coffee
and any food orders that were purchased the most (within the last month) and also would like to print a list
of materials that are low in the inventory.
Your team had been able to arrange another meeting with Oliver and were given more
requirements as below:
Oliver has decided to expand his business to other places. 
Further to the requirements mentioned above, the Bake Shop software needs to store records of all the
stores he owns, records of all the orders made and records of all the staff hired with respect to a store. All
the users are identified by employee id, name, email, password, TFN (Tax File Number), residential address
and phone number.

All the users of this system should be able to read the order, modify the order, view the order and delete the
order. Any order will have an item number, name of the item, quantity, order created by, order date, order
time, order status, name of the customer, cost per item and total cost. Order status can be confirmed,
preparing or ready. When an order is ready it will be archived automatically by the software.
Once a customer decides to order, they need to go to the counter and ask the staff to create their order.
When the staff will enter name of the item and the system should be able to find its item number and attach
it to the order. Then the staff should be able add the quantity and name of the customer. The system will
add order created by (based on staff’s login details), order date and order time. Where and when necessary
the system will check the data entered by the staff is valid. The staff will verbally confirm the order with
customer and then ask the customer to pay by cash. Once the customer has paid the order, the staff will
change the order status to confirmed and the order will be displayed on the barista’s screen.
A customer may make an advance order to roast coffee beans. Only the manager (June) and the owner
(Oliver) are allowed to roast coffee beans. Any staff should be able to add these types of orders in the order
list for the owner or the manager to prepare the order when they can. While adding this type of order to an
order list, staff will need to enter the same information as they would for any other order. However, the
customer’s phone number will also be added so that they can be informed when their order will be ready for
pickup.
The owner will want to generate a few things at the end of each week to see how his business is going. He
would require printing a list of items that are low in the inventory. He would also like to check the revenue
his business has generated over the last month. The owner should be able to find the total number of coffees,
coffee beans (in quantity) and food items sold in the last month, the type of coffee sold the most, the food
items sold the most, days of the week that made the most sale and total sale made in dollars.
During the meeting, the client could not think of anything else that he would need. However, while he was
leaving, he mentioned that there might be a need to add a few more things to the software since his business
is growing, and he would like to have everything at one place (in one software) to manage his business fully.
